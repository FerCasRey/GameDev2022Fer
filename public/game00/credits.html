        <h2 align="center">Thank you for playing</h2>
        <p>More than a game, this is a technical demo, to show the potencial of this with more time and means.</p> <br>
        <p>I hope you have enjoyed the little bit of creativity shown</p><br><br>
        <p>Nothing of this could have been accomplished without the help and teachings of Mr. E.</p>
        <p>Also, thank you, Pitis, for showing me the path of gaming and curiosity, and the rest of my family for the support on my hobbies.</p>
        <p>Daniel Mullings' games and graphic adventures ('Monkey Island', 'The Is No Game', 'Deponia'...) have <br> been of great importance in the development of this idea</p><br><br>
        <h3>But thank you the most, player, for taking the time. <br> May the path of gaming be clear and joyful</h3><br><br><br>
